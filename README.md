## About
Hi, I am Woonggi Eun.I just graduated from DigiPen Institute of Technology and currently looking for a job in US. I am interested in network/server programming recently and have done couple of projects related to it. But just because I have interests about backend, doesn't mean I don't attentive anything else. As you can see in my portfolio or [resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xq83UtJkHlWHHsVdAZLUtqCW46nkc56GyI09bwm_hZg/edit?usp=sharing), I finished various projects and classes and, I've learned a lot and got solid understandings about software engineering in general.

One of the strengths of mine is my experiences with academic projects. I might not have professional industry experiences or internships, but the thing is I learned a lot while I went through the projects and had numerous chances to overcome obstacles as well as chances to learn from them. I always try to keep my vibe positive because it has a lot more potential to solve problems than just being negativeðŸ˜Š
